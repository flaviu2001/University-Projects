Each student or team of 2 students will take one project. It is ok to take a theme that is not listed below (but check with the lab advisor before starting).
Each project will have 2 implementations: one with "regular" threads or tasks/futures, and one distributed (possibly, but not required, using MPI).
Task: Find an n-coloring of a graph.
Teammate: Custura Stefan-Octavian
I did the MPI solution only here.
