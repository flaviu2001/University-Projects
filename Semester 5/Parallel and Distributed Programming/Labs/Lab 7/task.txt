Goal

The goal of this lab is to implement a distributed algorithm using MPI.
Requirement

Perform the multiplication of 2 polynomials, by distributing computation across several nodes using MPI. Use both the regular O(n2) algorithm and the Karatsuba algorithm. Compare the performance with the "regular" CPU implementation from lab 5.

The documentation will describe:

    the algorithms,
    the distribution and communication,
    the performance measurements 

Bonus: do the same for the multiplication of big numbers.
