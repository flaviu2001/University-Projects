Goal

The goal of this lab is to implement a simple but non-trivial parallel algorithm.
Requirement

Perform the multiplication of 2 polynomials. Use both the regular O(n2) algorithm and the Karatsuba algorithm, and each in both the sequencial form and a parallelized form. Compare the 4 variants.

The documentation will describe:

    the algorithms,
    the synchronization used in the parallelized variants,
    the performance measurements 

Bonus: do the same for big numbers.
