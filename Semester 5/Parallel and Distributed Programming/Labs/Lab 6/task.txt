Goal

The goal of this lab is to implement a simple but non-trivial parallel algorithm.
Requirement

Solve the problem below:

Given a directed graph, find a Hamiltonean cycle, if one exists. Use multiple threads to parallelize the search.

The documentation will describe:

    the algorithms,
    the synchronization used in the parallelized variants,
    the performance measurements
