Statement: Considering a small programming language (that we shall call mini-langauge), write 3 small programs in this language.

Deliverables: p1.* , p2.*, and p3.* and p1err.*  -  small programs written in your programming language  (p1, p2, p3  should be lexically correct; p1err should contain 2 types of lexical errors).

For example: 

    p1 and p2: compute de max/min of 3 numbers; verify if a number is prime, compute gcd of 2 numbers, compute the solutions for a 2nd order equation, aso

    p3: compute the sum of n numbers, computer the max/min of n numbers
