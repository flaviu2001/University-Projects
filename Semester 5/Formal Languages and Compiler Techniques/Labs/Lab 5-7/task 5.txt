Assignment for a team of 2 students!

Statement: Implement a parser algorithm

1. One of the following parsing methods will be chosen (assigned by teaching staff):
    1.c. lr(0)

2. The representation of the parsing tree (output) will be (decided by the team):

    2.a. productions string (max grade = 8.5)

    2.b. derivations string (max grade = 9)

    2.c. table (using father and sibling relation) (max grade = 10)


PART 1: Deliverables 

    Class Grammar (required operations: read a grammar from file, print set of nonterminals, set of terminals, set of productions, productions for a given nonterminal, CFG check)

    Input files: g1.txt (simple grammar from course/seminar), g2.txt (grammar of the minilanguage - syntax rules from Lab 1b)
