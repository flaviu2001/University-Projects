Statement: Implement a scanner (lexical analyzer): Implement the scanning algorithm and use ST from lab 2 for the symbol table.

Input: Programs p1/p2/p3/p1err and token.in (see Lab 1a)

Output: PIF.out, ST.out, message “lexically correct” or “lexical error + location”

Deliverables: input, output, source code, documentation

Details:

    ST.out should give information about the data structure used in representation

    If there exists an error the program should give a description and the location (line and token)
