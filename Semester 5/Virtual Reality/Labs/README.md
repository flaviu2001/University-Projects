# Basic Math
This project is meant to teach basic ray tracing in C# by drawing spheres on the screen.

# Scene Graph
This project features a robot that moves it's hands and legs and follows the mouse cursor with its head in Unity. It is meant to teach the scene graph and how rotation/scaling/etc affects the children of a node.

# Physics
This project is meant to teach physics simulation in Unity by doing a cannon that shoots balls into a wall and the wall falling on a bell which rings upon collision.

# Final Project
This project is meant to treat a phobia of choice and was done in a team. We chose the fear of darkness and did a labyrinth that decreases the lightning around you as time went on, thus exposing you to darkness more and more until the end.
