Bulls and cows
This is a game played by the human player against the computer as follows
1. The computer selects a random 4-digits number, which has no repeating digits(e.g. 1234, 9508)
2. The player tries to guess the number
3. Each turn the player enters a 4-digit guess
4. The computer tells how many bulls (correct digits in the correct place) and cows(correct digit, but incorrect place) there are in the latest guess
5. Game is over when the number is guessed. The aim is to do this over the smallest number of turns possible
