# commandWord param1, param2
# add <student id>, <name>, <grade>
# delete <student id>
# list
# help
# exit

# e.g. add 123, Popescu Elena, 9

# feature-driven development

# function signature - uniquely identified the function(function name, input parameters, return type)
# 1. function signature
# 2. specification
# 3. we can write test for it

# what do test functions do?
# 1. Take no parameters -> we want them to have no context
# 2. Have no user input/output
# 3. If the code is correct do nothing visible
# 4. If the code has an error -> SCREAM!!!(ง ͠° ͟ل͜ ͡°)ง
