# Lab 11: Angular, Spring, JPA - mapping relationships
- Continue to work individually on the previous project (same repo)
- Implement relationships between entities; the fetch type will be eager
- There should be at least four root entities and one repository per root aggregate; there should be no repository for the link entities (e.g. StudentDiscipline); there should be at least one relationship from each of the following: many-to-many, one-to-many, one-to-one (many-to-many may be implemented with two one-to-many associations; one-to-one may be implemented with embeddable)
- Operations on the link entity (e.g. enroll students to disciplines, assign/view/etc grades); reports/statistics
