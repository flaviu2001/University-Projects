# Lab 6: Remoting
- Continue to work in teams on the generated repository from the previous lab
- Suggestion: at the end of this lab, the repository should contain two folders - one folder for Lab5 and another one for Lab6
- Convert your project from a client-server application using sockets to an application using RMI
- Use Spring remoting
- Data must be persisted to a database; use JdbcTemplate (Spring)
- Use Gradle for dependency management
- XML configuration for Spring is not allowed; annotations and Java Config classes only
