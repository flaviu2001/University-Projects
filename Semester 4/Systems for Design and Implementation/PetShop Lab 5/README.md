# Lab 5: Networking
- continue to work in teams
- convert your project to a client-server application using sockets
- **simulate an RPC server** (messages sent between the client and the server must be handled in a unitary manner (simulate RPC calls) )
- the server must be concurrent; use Java 8 language features; threads with ExecutorService
- on the client side, client.service calls must be **non-blocking**
- using external libraries for RPC is not allowed; only sockets
- only the db (jdbc) persistence is needed
- SOLID principles and other best practices discussed in the context of the previous project should also be applied here
