Develop a web application based on JSP (Java Server Pages) or Java Servlets.

All web pages should be accessible only if the user logs in using a username and a password (create a session each time a user logs in, and destroy the session when the user logs out). Have in mind the user experience when you implement the problem:

    add different validation logic for input fields
    do not force the user to input an ID for an item if he wants to delete/edit/insert it; this should happen automatically (e.g. the user clicks an item from a list, and a page/modal prepopulated with the data for that particular item is opened, where the user can edit it)
    add confirmation when the user deletes/cancels an item
    do a bare minimum CSS that at least aligns the various input fields

Solve the following problem using the JSP/Servlet technology. State information (between web requests) is always stored in a database; you may store some state information in cookies/session objects. Write a web application for maintaining a collection of URLs for a list of users. Each user can add or delete URLs from his/her collection. The user must authenticate prior to using the application. A guest user (i.e. not authenticated) can still see a list with the top 10 most popular URLs, but an authenticated user can see a list with the top N most popular URLs, where N is configurable by the user.
