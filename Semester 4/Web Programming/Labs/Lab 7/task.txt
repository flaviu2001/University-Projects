Write a web application for managing users in an enterprise system. The application should maintain various information about users in the database (i.e. name, username, password, age, role, profile, email, webpage etc.). The application should implement: user browsing (use AJAX for retrieving users from a specific role), user lookup based on his name, adding, removing and updating a user. Also, on the browsing page, the filter used for the previous browsing action (i.e. role), should be displayed (do this in javascript).
