Write a web page which displays a vertically sliding desktop like the ones used on the Android or iOS. The web page should have 4 desktops, each desktop having a distinct transparent background color or image and having distinct textual and image content. A desktop is a large div occupying (exactly or almost) the whole browser window. By default, desktop no. 1 should be shown to the user. If the user clicks somewhere on the desktop the desktop should be slided vertically to the bottom of the window and from the top of the window desktop no. 2 should slide vertically and occupy the whole browser window. Desktop sliding should be an animated transition and one desktop should not just instantly dissapear and the next desktop be displayed instead.
