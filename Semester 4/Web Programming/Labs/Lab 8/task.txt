Develop an Angular UI (user interface) for the PHP lab task you have solved for Lab7. So, the problem you need to solve for this lab will be the same problem you had for Lab7 (PHP, Ajax, JSON), the backend of the solution will be the same (i.e. the php code), but you have to change the frontend (html, css, javascript part) to be an Angular application.
