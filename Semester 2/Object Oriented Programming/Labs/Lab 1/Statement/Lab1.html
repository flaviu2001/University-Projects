Encircled by the gnarled forms of titanic trees, steeped in the perpetual phosphorescence of the encroaching vegetation, the city had stood on the edge of civilization since time immemorial. From its fortified walls, the members of the city watch formed tiny silhouettes against a backdrop of red-yellow incandescence – a wall of moss and vines from the depths of which the calls of unseen animals could be heard day and night.

As strange as it was ambitious, a great experiment had begun to take root. Normally content to keep to their own peculiar studies, locked away in domed edifices of learning, these conjurers, thaumaturges, mages or warlocks had always sparked feelings of apprehension in the lay populace from which they sought so hard to isolate themselves. However, the time had become ripe for change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style='text-indent:50px'&gt;The scholars now continuously migrating to the Ancient City on the border had a notion that magic would no longer – could no longer - reside in the lofty heights of abstract speculation. The rift between mage and commoner would be bridged – they hoped -, as the former would descend from his gilded tower and employ his talents to the benefit of the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style='text-indent:50px'&gt;You are one such magic user, currently residing in the renovated Academy Spire at the edge of town, apprenticed to the arch-mage Huric of Daras. Your personal chamber overlooks the gabled roofs and cobblestone streets winding far below. Nighttime has come, and your most recent assignment is overdue. The cheap parchment on which it was written by a clumsy hand, passed on to you by your superior, rests on your study table. It appears to be beckoning to you. The grizzled arch-mage had warned you that this task would be a feat of patience more than anything else. The road would be arduous, he added, but the fruits of your labor would be reaped as soon as people's minds would begin to warm up to the idea of being helped through more unconventional means. You shut the wooden blinds of your chamber window, blocking out the noises of the half-slumbering city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style='text-indent:50px'&gt;Runic set-up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style='text-indent:50px'&gt;Your master had first introduced you to runic incantations on the eve of your journey to the Ancient City. Old and of a more unrefined nature, the odd assortment of symbols could yet stir up arcane forces out of the aether. First School runes are what they were aptly called, and apprentices all across the land habitually sharpened their budding magical prowess using these. Next to your study desk lies a fine piece of masonry, a runic altar shipped straight from the Capital Academy. Upon it, you could experiment with any incantations before sending them out to whoever would be in need of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style='text-indent:50px'&gt;To begin, test out the runic altar’s arcane charge. It should be sufficient for future use if it can deliver brief messages to another altar. Convey a message to your master in the upper reaches of the Spire, using a simple set of First School runes. Whatever your quill inscribes on this parchment will appear on the second one.&lt;/p&gt;
