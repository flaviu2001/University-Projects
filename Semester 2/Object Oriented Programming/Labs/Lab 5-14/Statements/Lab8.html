&lt;p style='text-indent:50px'&gt;The sound of rain drops pattering on the window of your newly occupied tower chamber could not possibly lower your spirits. Nor could the image of an overcast day evoke the slightest pang of distress, with the City sprawling before your eyes, drenched in the waters that pour incessantly from the luminescent plant life above. As your rite of passage lies in the past, you find yourself comfortably making yourself at home in one of the larger studies of the upper levels of the Spire. As an officially acknowledged mage, albeit only of novice status, you have begun to discover both the privileges and the greater responsibilities that accompany your title. Archmage Huric personally congratulated you on your progression, nonchalantly sneaking in a remark about how the refurbished turrets sprinkled on the outer walls are in excellent condition. Cubbyholes filled with a staggering amount of scrolls stretch above your study, reminding you that a mage's work, no matter his prowess, is never quite done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style='text-indent:50px'&gt;You have taken the time to look over most of your assignments, and have decided to focus on the task entailed by what is probably the most imposing looking scroll you've ever seen – sealed with Brinewood Wax and safely tucked away in a tube of mahogany. It is specifically addressed to you and appears to be penned by the Grandmaster of the Tower Guards. With the directness and blocky, austere writing style that you've come to associate with soldierly characters, he respectfully requests that you send an incantation that will charge the new magical turrets of the City with added range and a garden variety of secondary elemental effects. Apparently, the beasts of the outer wilderness have been growing inexplicably restless lately, and have been spotted by members of the Night Watch, sniffing about the walls and moats by moonlight. Peculiar as this event is, a small number of them could prove to be dangerous, both to the citizens and the infrastructure of the walls – especially the hoofed lorrgols and the wrendiggers. In situations like these it is better to be safe than sorry. A meager improvement of your previous enchantment should fix things up for the Guard captain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style='text-indent:50px'&gt;For your previous assignment, add the following features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace your DynamicVector template with the STL vector. Use STL algorithms wherever possible in your application (e.g. in your filter function you could use copy_if, count_if). Replace all your for loops either with STL algorithms, or with the ranged-based for loop (C++11).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create and use a new repository to store your domain data in a text file, but not the &quot;mylist&quot;. Do not cache the data in memory, all operations will only use files. If there is no file at the provided location create one. For this feature, use the iostream library. Create insertion and extraction operators for your entities and use these when reading/writing to files or console.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the functions in your application must be specified and tested. Using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/~iuliana/oop/Tutorials/Code_coverage.pdf&quot;&gt;OpenCppCoverage tool&lt;/a&gt;, make sure you have at least 99% coverage for all your modules, except for the UI. For Linux, you may use any appropriate tool you find.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p style='text-indent:50px'&gt;All incantations must be spoken in the form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fileLocation fullPath (e.g. fileLocation c:\some really long\path\with spaces\myFileName.txt) - the enchantments must use this location from now on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All previous enchantments must work with the given file (add, update, delete, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example test run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;call: fileLocation c:\some really long\path\with spaces\myFileName.txt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;call: mode A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;call: add [valid input]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;call: list &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check for [valid input in any format, in c:\some really long\path\with spaces\myFileName.txt]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt;The server will call list just in case you use that as a trigger to save, but will only test the file contents for correctness.&lt;/p&gt;
