&lt;p style='text-indent:50px'&gt;An eye of calm has opened in the worming of feet on the battlements. Dorlom of Vuth towers above a small congregation of novices, preparing to give a rousing speech. He fixes you with his stern glare and raises his voice, so that the other mages posted on the wall can hear him speak as well. With the pedantic cadence of one who is accustomed to lecturing, he explains to you all that Tetherstep Dragons have two distinctive traits, apart from their ferocious tempers and immense size: firstly, they boast an unusual affinity for magical force, themselves being in turn capable of harnessing and tapping into arcane fonts of power at a whim. Sudden shifts in amounts of magic being used up or propelled through the aether can easily disturb their age-long hibernation – which in turn has visible emotional effects on magically inclined individuals. Secondly, despite the longevity of said hibernation, Tetherstep Dragons are surprisingly light sleepers once you factor in magical disturbances. Seems like the recent re-emergence of mages in the Ancient City has caused the rude awakening of this particular specimen. You are all going to have to push him away from the City, or else the next morning might not find a city to shed its light upon. First and foremost, all Norven Turrets had to be activated without exception and promptly directed to fire at the beast's joints and exposed underside. The wings would also have to be prioritized – the dragon would have to be kept grounded at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style='text-indent:50px'&gt;Dorlom has concocted a solution that is equally daring and dangerous. Should it work, the Tetherstep dragon might be driven off, but it will require the refinement of a plethora of the Spire's finest enchantments. Dorlom's main altar on the battlements needs to be charged with visual representations of your most complex enchantments – the one you have been working on should be more than a sufficient contribution to the effort. Charging the altar with the arcane projections of dozens of enchantments, a searing ray will be conjured up by the archmage of Vuth and directed at the great beast, hopefully deterring its march. Should his channeling fail, the entire wall could be compromised, leaving the City wide open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a multiple undo and redo functionality for the operations “add”, “remove”, “update” in your repository. Implement this functionality using inheritance and polymorphism. You will have a “Undo” and “Redo” buttons on your GUI, as well as a key combination to undo and redo the operations (e.g. Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new window which presents the contents of &quot;mylist&quot;
&lt;p&gt;This window will contain a list view/table view with all the elements in your list. You must use Qt View/Model components (QListView/QTableView). Create your own model – a class which inherits from QAbstractListModel or QAbstractTableModel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This window will be opened from your GUI main window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Add a multiple undo and redo functionality for your adoption list/movie watch list/shopping basket/tutorial watch list. We have to be able to test it using your GUI application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use custom delegates in Qt. In one of the columns of the Qt table view that shows the elements in your &quot;mylist&quot;, display an image of the dog/trench coat (for problems 1 and 3), or a play button (for problems 2 and 4) – which can play the movie trailer or the tutorial.
