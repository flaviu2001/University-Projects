&lt;p style='text-indent:50px'&gt;A cool gust of air brushes past you in your tower room. Surrounded by tomes and trying to block out all other stimuli, you notice how the heavy steps of soldiers marching outside make for a most jarring distraction. Archmage Huric had left the chamber hours ago, coldly congratulating you on your progress and handing you a peculiar gift, in the form of a rare book of High Runes(C++), shipped last year straight from the Capital Library for his personal use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style='text-indent:50px'&gt;It's early evening now, and it's about time you took care of some of your new tasks. Through your window, you glance at the shifting canopy high above the rooftops, a living blanket tinged with the dying red light of sunset. You can't put your finger on it, but something feels off. A touch of melancholy? You brush it off and start to sift through the pile of scrolls on your study. They have definitely multiplied lately, and it seems other apprentices in the Spire have also been getting more than they could chew thrown at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style='text-indent:50px'&gt;A Captain of the City Watch has had a low-ranking subordinate bring you a missive, with the whispered mention that your involvement should best remain in the dark. High ranking artificers of the Spire, specialized in autonomancy, have been giving a helping hand to the Council, sprucing up the worn-out magical defenses of the Ancient City. A few dozen Norven Turrets, made from the strongest granite and reinforced with freshly enchanted runic sigils had been prepared as of late. They now had to be lifted high-up on the battlements, placed strategically so as to dot the whole vertebrae-like outer wall of the City. You suspect this message was meant for other ears, way above your head. Still, a chance to prove your worth might be in the cards for you, should you risk taking on this endeavor instead of reporting it to the ones for whom the message was undoubtedly intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style='text-indent:50px'&gt;The Captain needs you to weave an enchantment affixed to an altar that will help the Watch and its members manipulate and harness the Norven turrets on the outer walls. Most of the partially refurbished constructs were still covered in scaffolding, provisionally awaiting their awakening. The Captain is in need of a locally focused enchantment that can allow his underlings to select which turret they can activate â€“ with the implied ulterior attempt to probe its defensive capabilities. Norven turrets are something you have only read about in dusty tomes back home, but you are certain that your newfound confidence and prowess (also coupled with Huric's generous gift) can tip the scales in your favor and ensure that the task will be accomplished effortlessly. The enchantment that you'll be affixing to a runic altar on the battlements can be used in two patterns of communion, as per the Captain's suggestions: Watch Officer and Watchman. When the altar and its corresponding enchantment are activated, it will offer the option to choose the pattern of communion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style='text-indent:50px'&gt;Watch Officer communion pattern: The enchantment will contain an encyclopedia, which holds all the available Norven turrets sprinkled across the outer walls. The elder members of the City Watch must be able to update the encyclopedia, meaning: add a new Norven turret to its count, de-materialize a turret (if proven to be unstable or otherwise not functional) and update the lore of any of the existing turrets. These powers can be accessed only when in mode A. Each Norven turret has a location, size, an arcane aura level, a quantity of their separate parts (some of them being composed of clusters of levitating mineral fragments) and a scryer's mirror-image of their corporeal likeness. The mirror-image is memorized and is linked to another runic altar located within the City Keep, being equally accessible by anyone therein â€“ provided they are in possession of the necessary communion incantation. The Officers of the Watch will also have the possibility to see all the Norven turrets available in the encyclopedia. Also since the Watch members are not accustomed to magic, make sure they cannot fumble their words. You decide to use the technique called DynamicVector defined by you, from which mana does not leak. Make sure to (unit) test everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style='text-indent:50px'&gt;All enchantments must take the form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mode X (e.g. mode A)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add location, size, auraLevel, separateParts, vision (e.g. add south-west wall center, medium, 500, 33000, great stone tower)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;update location, newSize, newAuraLevel, newSeparateParts, newVision (e.g. south-west wall center, huge, 500, 50000, magnificent stone tower)&lt;/li&gt;
