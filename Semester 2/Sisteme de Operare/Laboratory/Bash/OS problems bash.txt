1. Write a bash script that calculates the sum of the sizes of all text files in a given folder.

2. Write a script that reads filenames until the word "stop" is entered. For each filename, check if it is a text file and if it is, print the number of words on the first line.

3. Write a script that receives as command line arguments pairs consisting of a filename and a word. For each pair, check if the given word appears at least 3 times in the file and print a corresponding message.

4. Sort all files given as command line arguments descending by size.

5. Write a script that extracts from all the C source files given as command line arguments the included libraries and saves them in a file.

6. Seminar problem: Write a script that monitors the state of a given folder and prints a message when something changed.

7. Find recursively in a given directory all the symbolic links, and report those that point to files/directories that no longer exist. Use option -L to test if a path is a symbolic link, and option -e to test if it exists (will return false if the target to which the link points does not exist)

8. Write a script that receives program/process names as command line arguments. The script will monitor all the processes in the system, and whenever a program with one of those names is run, the script will kill it and display a message. (see commands ps, kill, killall)

9. Write a script that receives a directory as a command line argument. The script will delete all the C source files from the directory and will display all other text files sorted alphabetically.
