GREP

grep -i -> case insensitive
grep -v -> invert match
/etc/passwd - username:password:uid:gid:info:home-dir:shell
"dan"									(searches all names containing dan as a subsequence anywhere in the field)
"^[^0-9:]\+:"							(searches all lines with no numbers in their username field)
"^[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^Uu:]*:"		(searches all lines with no 'u' in their info field)
"^\([^:]*:\)\{4\}[^Uu:]*:"				(same thing but smarter)
"ceva" file.txt | wc -l 				(displays the number of lines outputted by grep)
"^$"									(empty lines)
grep -v "^$"							(all non-empty lines)
"^\(..\)*.$"							(odd length)
"\<joe\>|\<john\>"						(lines that contain joe or john)
grep -i -v "\<john\>.*\<joe\>\|\<joe\>.*\<john\>"	(clears all named john joe or joe john)
grep -i "\<joe\>" a.txt | grep -i -v "\<john\>"		(same thing)


SED

search replace
sed "s/\<john\>/joe/gi"
		search  replace	flags
		for		with
-g replace everywhere on the line
-i case insensitive
sed "s/.*\///"				(shows all shells used in /etc/passwd)
sed "s,.*/,,"				(same but other separator for sed)
sed "s/\([aeiou]\)/\1\1/gi"	(doubles each vowel)
sed "/\<joe\>/d"			(deletes lines containing joe)
sed "y/abc/123/"			(transliteraion)
sed "y/aeiou/AEIOU"			(changes all lowercase vowels to uppercase)
tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'
