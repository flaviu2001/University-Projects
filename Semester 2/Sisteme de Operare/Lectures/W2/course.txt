0 == success == TRUE
not 0 == failure == FALSE
There are the commands true and false
true has exit code 0
false has exit code 1
echo $? 	-> shows exit code of last command
true || echo not going to be shown
|| works on exit codes
echo "adsada" | grep -i "[aeiou]" || echo qqqqqqqqqq
echo "adsada" | grep -i -q "[aeiou]" || echo qqqqqqqqqq

test
strings: == != -n -z
integers: -lt -le -eq -ne -ge -gt
files: -e -f -d -r -w -x
These are all in man test

bash has variables
A="Tom"
echo $A
echo ${A}cat
C=`wc -l < a`
echo $C
echo '$A has `wc -l < a` apple'	-> apostrophes do not allow substitutions
echo "$A has `wc -l < a` apple"	-> quotes do allow substitutions

#-comment

$0,$1...$9(arguments) , have to use shift for more than 10
Special :$*, $#, $?

Shift: Gets rid of argument on the left and changes index of all by -1
Shift (number of times)
When you execute the file , have to give arguments


#!/bin/bash
echo $1 $2 $3
shift
shift
echo $1 $2 $3

./args.sh a b c d e f
a b c
c d e

for A in a b c d e; do
        echo $A
done
//This prints a b c d e on new lines


*- wildcard:
e.g.:for F in * (for every file in directory)
for F in *.sh(for every file ending in .sh in directory

Should have printed out all directories too, but it didn't . A lot of permissions denied ,though. Maybe because it goes up from root in my case?(find ..)

IF- Ends with fi
-elif
-else

file- tells you things about files

#!/bin/bash
