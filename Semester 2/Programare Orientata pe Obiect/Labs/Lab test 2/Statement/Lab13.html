&lt;p style='text-indent:50px'&gt;Furious knocks have awakened you with a start, enclosed in darkness and drenched in sweat. The moment you nudge your door ajar, fully armored soldiers seize you and drag you out, all the while blaring incomprehensible warnings. They seem stricken with some other-worldly terror that is making them quiver as they bark out orders with unequal voices. They're trying to tell you that you are desperately needed on the battlements, as a great cataclysm might well be underway and someone with your rare capabilities has to be there in order to try and prevent this impending doom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style='text-indent:50px'&gt;With alacrity, you are rushed out of the Spire and led through the empty streets, hearing the echoes of faint screams that grow in intensity as you approach the outer walls. Making your way through thicker and thicker crowds that shove and push against you and your plated convoy, you are eventually seen up a circular tower stairwell and soon find yourself on the southern walls of the Ancient City, above the main gate and looking out into the shadowy woods, from which an unearthly roar can be heard. While you start to discern a colossal shadow practically ripping up the midnight landscape in the distance, a nearby voice casually informs you that you're dealing with a Tetherstep Dragon. You turn around, opening you eyes in disbelief as you lay your eyes on Grand Archmage Dorlom of Vuth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style='text-indent:50px'&gt;Further explanations would have to wait.  A guard captain needs an enchantment to aid with the list of Guardian Statues conjured and sent on their way to help. Keeping track of them will help the mages issue orders and more efficiently distribute the hulking brutes along the battlements. Each Statue has as attributes: its conjurer's name, model (indicating the material it was sculpted from), year of fabrication and colour (indicating its level of arcane charge). Weave an enchantment that, when affixed to an alter, can show and contain at least 5 varieties of Guardian Statues. See an example below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calagron | Hornstone | 350 | red&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weave an enchantment that can bring up a graphical user interface (use the Qt framework) which allows its user to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualize all the Guardian Statues in a list (QListWidget or QListView). The list will display the conjurer's name and the model. When the enchantment is activated, the list is populated automatically &lt;b&gt;(2.5p)&lt;/b&gt; and the Statued are sorted by conjurer &lt;b&gt;(1.5p)&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show the Statues in the list such that the font colour of each one is the same as the Statue's colour (assume we only have colours the same as Qt predefined colours – class QColor). &lt;b&gt;(1p)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show the number of Statues, for a given conjurer. The conjurer is input in a QLineEdit and when the button “Show Statues” is clicked, the number of Guardian Statues from that specific conjurer will be shown (in a QLineEdit, a QLabel or a new widget). &lt;b&gt;(3p)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write specifications and tests for the function that computes the number of Statues, by conjurer. &lt;b&gt;(0.5p specification, 0.5p - tests)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obs.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the data are not read from the file, 0.5 points are subtracted from the indicated score for each functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The enchantment must use a layered architecture. If you do not use a layered architecture, the maximum score for each requirement is 50% of the indicated score.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source files must be sent to commit@scs.ubbcluj.ro no later than 10 minutes after exam end. If you have the labs with Imre also upload here.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may use Qt Designer. A quick refference for documentation: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.cppreference.com/w/&quot;&gt;http://en.cppreference.com/w/&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cplusplus.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.cplusplus.com/&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/&quot;&gt;http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
