Lab 1. Database Design

    assigned: week 1; due: week 3

Imagine a simple application that requires a database. Represent the application data in a relational structure and implement the structure in a SQL Server database. The database must contain at least: 10 tables, two 1:n relationships, one m:n relationship.

Before you start working, send an e-mail to the lab assistant with the application for which you want to create the database, along with a short description. In case of conflicts, first in the list wins, so check existing entries here to make sure your topic hasnâ€™t already been chosen.
