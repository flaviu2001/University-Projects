The client sends the complete path to a file. The server returns back the length of the file and its content in the case the file exists. When the file does not exist the server returns a length of -1 and no content. The client will store the content in a file with the same name as the input file with the suffix â€“copy appended (ex: for f.txt => f.txt-copy).
